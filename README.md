Overview - Rails Project/Flatiron School/ J. Gladstone


The application is for a Luxury Day Spa which allows clients to sign up and book appointments with staff members for certain services.

The application uses Omniauth/Facebook for users who would like to login using OAuth.
The requirements for the project are listed in the spec.md file.

I have added seed data for testing and used basic css for styling.

To install this app, follow these steps:

Fork and clone the repository, run bundle install, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, rails s and open browser to localhost:3000.
